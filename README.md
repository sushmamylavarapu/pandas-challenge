Impact of Budget on Student Performance:
The analysis showed that Schools with higher budgets per student tended to have higher average math and reading scores. Additionally, the percentages of students passing math and reading exams were also higher in schools with larger budgets. This indicates that adequate funding plays a key role in improving student results.

Influence of School Type on Student Performance:
The analysis also compared the performance of different school types. Charter schools consistently outperformed district schools across various metrics and had higher average math & reading scores, as well as higher % of students passing math and reading exams. This suggests that the school type can impact student achievement, with charter schools demonstrating better academic performance overall.
